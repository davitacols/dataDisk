## 📅 Week-by-Week Action Plan

- [ ] Schedule 5 customer interviews

**Script for outreach:**
```
Subject: Quick question about patient data de-identification

Hi [Name],

I'm building a tool to automate HIPAA-compliant data de-identification 
for small healthcare providers. Currently testing with a few clinics.

Quick question: How do you currently handle de-identifying patient data 
when sharing with partners/researchers?

Would love 15 minutes to understand your process.

Best,
[Your Name]

## 💰 Financial Projections

### Conservative Scenario
| Month | Customers | MRR    | Costs  | Profit |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1     | 3         | $897   | $200   | $697   |
| 2     | 5         | $1,495 | $300   | $1,195 |
| 3     | 10        | $2,990 | $500   | $2,490 |

| 12    | 35        | $10,465| $2,000 | $8,465 |

### Optimistic Scenario
| Month | Customers | MRR     | Costs  | Profit  |
|-------|-----------|---------|--------|---------|
| 1     | 5         | $1,495  | $200   | $1,295  |
| 2     | 10        | $2,990  | $300   | $2,690  |
| 3     | 15        | $4,485  | $500   | $3,985  |
| 6     | 30        | $8,970  | $1,000 | $7,970  |
| 12    | 50        | $14,950 | $2,500 | $12,450 |

### Costs Breakdown
- **Hosting**: $50/month (AWS/DigitalOcean)
- **Tools**: $100/month (email, CRM, analytics)
- **Marketing**: $500/month (ads, content)
- **Support**: $1,000/month (part-time, month 3+)
- **Legal**: $500 one-time (BAA review)

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Week 1 (Validation)
- ✅ 10 customer interviews completed
- ✅ 3 people say "I would pay for this"
- ✅ Landing page live with 100+ visitors

### Month 1 (Beta)
- ✅ 3-5 beta customers at $99/month
- ✅ Average time saved: 10+ hours/month
- ✅ 2 testimonials collected

### Month 3 (Launch)
- ✅ 10 paying customers ($2,990 MRR)
- ✅ 50% trial-to-paid conversion
- ✅ <$300 customer acquisition cost

### Month 6 (Growth)
- ✅ 20 paying customers ($5,980 MRR)
- ✅ 80% customer retention
- ✅ 1 enterprise customer

### Month 12 (Scale)
- ✅ 35 paying customers ($10,465 MRR)
- ✅ Break-even on CAC
- ✅ 90% customer retention

## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch For

### Stop if:
1. **No one will pay**: After 20 sales calls, no one commits to $99/month
2. **No time savings**: Customers don't save 5+ hours/month
3. **High churn**: >50% of customers cancel in first 3 months
4. **Legal issues**: HIPAA liability concerns can't be resolved
5. **Low willingness to pay**: Can't charge >$200/month

### Pivot if:
1. **Wrong target market**: Small clinics don't buy, but research labs do
2. **Wrong pricing**: Need to go enterprise ($5K+/month) or freemium
3. **Wrong features**: Customers want EHR integration more than de-identification

## 💡 Key Insights from Today

### What Makes This Viable:
1. **Clear pain point**: Manual de-identification takes 10+ hours
2. **Willingness to pay**: Compliance = non-negotiable
3. **Underserved market**: Small clinics can't afford $50K+ tools
4. **Recurring revenue**: Monthly subscription model
5. **Low competition**: Most tools target enterprises

### Competitive Advantages:
1. **Price**: 10x cheaper than alternatives
2. **Simplicity**: Works with CSV/Excel (no complex setup)
3. **Speed**: 10K records in <5 minutes
4. **Compliance**: HIPAA-compliant by default
5. **Python-native**: Integrates with data science workflows

### Risks to Mitigate:
1. **HIPAA liability**: Get legal review, offer BAA, clear disclaimers
2. **Sales cycle**: Focus on SMB (faster) before enterprise
3. **Technical complexity**: Offer white-glove onboarding
4. **Competition**: Move fast, build moat with integrations
