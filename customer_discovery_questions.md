# 🎯 Customer Discovery Questions

## Interview Script (15 minutes)

### Introduction (1 min)
```
Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time to chat!

I'm building a tool to help healthcare organizations de-identify patient data faster and more reliably. I'm talking to folks like you to understand the current process and pain points.

This is just research - I'm not selling anything today. Sound good?
```

### Current Process (5 min)

**Q1: Do you currently need to de-identify patient data?**
- If NO: "What prevents you from sharing data with partners/researchers?"
- If YES: Continue...

**Q2: How often do you need to de-identify data?**
- Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Quarterly / Annually
- How many records per dataset?

**Q3: Walk me through your current de-identification process.**
- Who does it? (Role/title)
- What tools do you use? (Excel, custom scripts, manual?)
- How long does it take?
- What's the most time-consuming part?

**Q4: What identifiers do you remove?**
- Names, SSN, dates, addresses?
- Do you know all 18 HIPAA identifiers?
- How do you ensure you didn't miss anything?

**Q5: How do you verify the data is compliant?**
- Manual review?
- Checklist?
- Legal review?
- Nothing formal?

### Pain Points (3 min)

**Q6: What's the most frustrating part of this process?**
- Time-consuming?
- Error-prone?
- Expensive?
- Compliance concerns?

**Q7: Have you ever had a compliance issue or close call?**
- What happened?
- How did you fix it?
- What did it cost (time/money)?

**Q8: If you could wave a magic wand, what would the ideal solution look like?**
- Listen carefully - this reveals what they value most

### Current Solutions (2 min)

**Q9: Have you looked at tools to automate this?**
- If YES: "Which ones? Why didn't they work?"
- If NO: "Why not?"

**Q10: What's your budget for a solution like this?**
- Per month or per project?
- What would justify that cost?

### Willingness to Pay (2 min)

**Q11: If there was a tool that could de-identify 10,000 records in 5 minutes, HIPAA-compliant, with audit logging - what would that be worth to you?**
- Listen for specific numbers
- Compare to current cost (time × hourly rate)

**Q12: Would you pay $299/month for that?**
- If YES: "Great! Would you be interested in beta testing?"
- If NO: "What price point would work for you?"

### Closing (2 min)

**Q13: Is there anything else I should know about your de-identification process?**

**Q14: Can I follow up with you once we have a beta version?**
- Get email
- Ask for referrals: "Do you know anyone else who might have this problem?"

```
Thanks so much for your time! This was incredibly helpful.

I'll send you a summary of what we discussed and keep you posted on progress.

## Red Flags (Stop Signals)

❌ **Don't pursue if:**
1. They don't de-identify data (no problem to solve)
2. They do it <1x per year (not frequent enough)
3. They have <100 records per dataset (too small)
4. They say "we're happy with current process" and won't elaborate
5. Budget is <$50/month (not viable)
6. They need 6+ months to make a decision (too slow)

---

## Green Flags (Strong Signals)

✅ **Pursue aggressively if:**
1. They de-identify data monthly or more
2. Current process takes 5+ hours
3. They've had compliance concerns
4. They're paying consultants $500+
5. They say "I wish there was a tool for this"
6. Budget is $200+/month
7. They can make decision in <30 days
8. They ask "when can I try it?"

## Interview Scoring

Rate each interview 1-5 on:
- **Problem severity** (1=minor annoyance, 5=critical pain)
- **Frequency** (1=yearly, 5=daily)
- **Willingness to pay** (1=<$50/mo, 5=$500+/mo)
- **Decision speed** (1=>6 months, 5=<2 weeks)
- **Enthusiasm** (1=polite, 5=excited)

**Total score:**
- 20-25: Hot lead - follow up immediately
- 15-19: Warm lead - follow up within 1 week
- 10-14: Cool lead - add to nurture list
- <10: Not a fit - thank and move on

## Key Insights to Extract

After 10 interviews, answer:

1. **What's the #1 pain point?**
   - Time? Cost? Compliance? Errors?

2. **What's the average time spent per dataset?**
   - This determines ROI messaging

3. **What's the average willingness to pay?**
   - This validates pricing

4. **What features are must-haves vs nice-to-haves?**
   - This guides development priorities

5. **What objections come up repeatedly?**
   - This informs sales messaging

6. **Who's the decision maker?**
   - This guides targeting

7. **What's the typical buying process?**
   - This informs sales cycle expectations

## Validation Criteria

**Proceed to build if:**
- ✅ 7+ out of 10 people have the problem
- ✅ 5+ out of 10 would pay $200+/month
- ✅ 3+ out of 10 want to try it immediately
- ✅ Average time saved is 5+ hours per dataset
- ✅ Decision timeline is <60 days

**Pivot if:**
- ❌ <5 out of 10 have the problem
- ❌ <3 out of 10 would pay $100+/month
- ❌ No one wants to try it
- ❌ Time saved is <2 hours
