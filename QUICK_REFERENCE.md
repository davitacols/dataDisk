## 🎤 Common Objections & Responses

### "We don't have budget"
**Response:** "This saves 10+ hours per dataset. At $50/hour, that's $500+ in value. Tool pays for itself with one dataset per month. Beta pricing is only $99/month."

### "We need to check with legal"
**Response:** "Absolutely. I can provide HIPAA compliance docs, sample BAA, and security documentation. Want me to join a call with your legal team?"

### "We're happy with current process"
**Response:** "That's great! How long does it typically take? And how do you ensure all 18 HIPAA identifiers are removed? Most clinics miss identifiers like device IDs and IP addresses."

### "Can we try it first?"
**Response:** "Absolutely! Free trial, no credit card required. Upload a sample dataset and see results in 5 minutes. If it doesn't save you time, just cancel."
