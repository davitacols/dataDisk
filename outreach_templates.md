Hi [Name],

I noticed [Clinic Name] works with [research partners/quality improvement/data sharing].

Quick question: How do you currently handle de-identifying patient data when sharing with partners or researchers?

Would love 15 minutes to understand your current process and see if this could help.

Available for a quick call this week?

Specifically looking for:
- HIPAA Safe Harbor compliant
- Works with CSV/Excel
- Audit logging
- Under $500/month

Thanks!

## Objection Handling

### "We don't have budget"
```
I totally understand. What if I told you this could save you 10+ hours per dataset?

At $50/hour, that's $500+ in value. The tool pays for itself with just one dataset per month.

Plus, beta pricing is only $99/month - less than 2 hours of staff time.
```

### "We need to check with legal"
```
Absolutely - compliance is critical. 

I can provide:
- HIPAA Safe Harbor compliance documentation
- Sample BAA (Business Associate Agreement)
- Audit log examples
- Security documentation

Would it help if I joined a call with your legal team?
```

### "We're happy with our current process"
```
That's great! Out of curiosity, how long does it typically take to de-identify a dataset?

[Listen]

And how do you ensure all 18 HIPAA identifiers are removed?

[Listen]

The reason I ask is most clinics don't realize they're missing identifiers like device IDs, IP addresses, or geographic subdivisions. Our tool catches all of them automatically.

Would you be open to running one dataset through our tool just to compare?
```

### "Can we try it first?"
```
Absolutely! That's exactly what the free trial is for.

No credit card required. Upload a sample dataset and see results in 5 minutes.

If it doesn't save you time, no worries - just cancel.

Want me to send you the trial link?
